# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends throughout different types of campaigns. 
## Category Outcomes
The following chart shows the outcomes on the different types of Kickstarter campaigns in the US.

The music and theater categories have the most succesful outcomes. We're interested in theater fundraising campaigns. This category shows a high failed outcome as well. 
## Analyzing Theater Campaigns
Inside theater campaigns, the client is interested only in the subcategory of plays. 
It is now important to know if there's a specific time of the year when these campaigns tend to be succesful.

Campaigns tend to be more succesful when they're launched during the months of June and July. The length of fundraising campaigns are usually short, they last for a month or maybe two months. Failed campaigns during those months are high too. A more profound analysis is needed.
### Theater Campaigns Statistics

This chart shows that the average successful goal is $5049. The client is asking for almost double the amount of that average. Even so, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the succesful pledges, meaning that those campaigns failed for reasons other than asking for too much money. 
## Conclusion
After analyzing the Kickstarter Campaigns data we recommend our client to launch her campaign during the months of June or July. Getting a high amount of backers will be easy during those months and that will help her reach the goal of $10000.
