# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise's fundraising campaign for her play was close to reach its goal in a short amount of time. She's now interested in knowing how different campaigns went in relation to the date they launched and their funding goals.   
### Purpose
Visualize and analyze campaign outcomes based on their launched dates and their funding goals.  
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A pivot table was created to show the theater outcomes based on launch date. The table was filtered based on the "Parent Category" of Theater and "Years". The date is showing only the months of the year, as knowing in which year each outcome took place is irrelevant for the analysis. The columns were filtered to show "successful", "failed", and "canceled" outcomes. 
The following line chart was created to visualize what the pivot table was showing.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A new table was created in order to calculate the percentage of failed, successful and canceled outcomes in the subcategory of "Plays" are there. The different Goals from campaigns were separated in ranges.

The previous image is showing the percentage of all outcomes and we discovered there are no canceled outcomes on plays. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For these two analyses, the Excell skills learned were used. A graph and pivot table were created, as well as a new function. There were no big challenges, but using the function and accomodating the criteria correctly was a little bit tricky as we worked with ranges.   

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The number of succesful outcomes peaks on May. From there, succesful outcomes begin to decline. This means the best month to launch a kickstarter campaign is May.
The highest number of failed outcomes is May too. If we look at the rest of the months' failed outcomes and their total number of campaigns launched, we can see that at least around 1/3 of the launched campaigns of each month are gonna fail.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Having a high goal doesn't have anything to do with having a failed/canceled outcome. Not reaching a campaign goal must have to do with something other than asking for too much money. Maybe your campaign is just not good enough or attractive enough for people to back your campaign. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We have no knowledge of the exact reason why some campaigns are successful and why other campaigns aren't. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Doing a table for succesful, failed and canceled outcomes, one table for each of them and analyze them with different filters and variables. That way we're gonna have a more profound view of those plays and the reason of their outcome.
