# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise's fundraising campaign for her play was close to reach its goal in a short amount of time. She's now interested in knowing how different campaigns went in relation to the date they launched and their funding goals.   
### Purpose
Visualize and analyze campaign outcomes based on their launched dates and their funding goals.  
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A pivot table was created to show the theater outcomes based on launch date. The table was filtered based on the "Parent Category" of Theater and "Years". The date is showing only the months of the year, as knowing in which year each outcome took place is irrelevant for the analysis. The columns were filtered to show "successful", "failed", and "canceled" outcomes. 
The following line chart was created to visualize what the pivot table was showing. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For these two analyses, the Excell skills learned were used. A graph and pivot table were created, as well as a new function. There were no big challenges, but using the function and accomodating the criteria correctly was a little tricky as we worked with ranges.   

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
